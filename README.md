# 🪖 Helmet Violation Detection using YOLOv8

This project detects violations of helmet rules by motorcyclists using computer vision and deep learning. It leverages the YOLOv8 object detection model to identify motorcyclists and classify whether they are wearing helmets.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Motorcycle riders are at high risk in road traffic, especially in developing countries. Wearing helmets is mandatory in many regions, but enforcement is difficult. This project aims to automatically detect riders and passengers who are not wearing helmets using video surveillance data.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/)
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Spyder (IDE)
- GPU: Trained and tested on NVIDIA RTX 3050 Ti

## 🧠 Dataset

The dataset consists of 100 real-world traffic surveillance videos (20s each).  
Due to licensing restrictions, **the dataset and extracted frames are not included in this repository**.

- Annotation format:
  ```
  <video_id>, <frame>, <x>, <y>, <width>, <height>, <class_id>
  ```
- Class labels (after cleaning):
  ```
  0: motorbike
  1: DHelmet
  2: DNoHelmet
  3: P1Helmet
  4: P1NoHelmet
  5: P2Helmet
  6: P2NoHelmet
  7: P0Helmet
  8: P0NoHelmet
  ```

## 📈 Outputs

Trained model and logs are saved under:
```
runs/helmet-detection/
```

Evaluation files are stored under the `report/` folder:

- `report/results.png`: training curves  
- `report/results.csv`: contains mAP, precision, recall scores for each epoch  
- `report/confusion_matrix.png`: class-wise performance overview  
- `report/P_curve.png`, `report/R_curve.png`, `report/F1_curve.png`: class-wise precision-recall-f1 charts

---

## 📊 Evaluation Summary

- mAP@50: ~0.80  
- Precision: ~0.75  
- Recall: ~0.70  

The model was trained using YOLOv8 on a cleaned dataset of helmet usage in real traffic videos.  
It successfully detects both motorbike riders and their helmet status with high confidence.
